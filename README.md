This is a web application made for implementing the dbms project : BLOOD BANK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
App.js is the main frontend file, and I have used reactjs in it, App.css is the css file of our frontend. I have used Axios wth reactjs. 
index.js is the main backend file and I have used nodejs, express and vscode's mysql extension in it.
